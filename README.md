# ballslang
a simple compiled language i made in rust. it uses intermediate representation (IR) instead of an abstract syntax tree (AST).
documentation will come once the language comes along more and things get to a solider point.
examples will come before docs, but will have to wait until the language is functional.
compilation instructions will follow suit.
