# lye-lang
a simple compiled language i made in rust. it uses intermediate representation (IR) instead of an abstract syntax tree (AST).

documentation will come once the language comes along more and things get to a solider point.

examples will come before docs, but will have to wait until the language is functional.

compilation instructions will follow suit.

## roadmap
### 1.0.0
- [x] constants
- [x] print statement
- [ ] goto
- [ ] while loop
- [ ] conditional statements
- [ ] strongly-typed mutable variables
- [ ] strongly-typed constants (to replace the current constants)
- [ ] casting int to string and vice versa
- [ ] importing functions from other files


- [ ] code examples
- [ ] some documentation of the standard library and syntax
- [ ] installer with ballslang compiler, nasm, and golink
- [ ] command-line arguments instead of hardcoded values
